# MCP Registry Growth Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Static Site Architecture
All components must generate static HTML/CSS/JS files; No server-side rendering or dynamic backends required; Build-time data processing and generation preferred; Deployable to CDNs and static hosting platforms

### II. Responsive Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Mobile-first design approach mandatory; Fluid layouts that adapt to all screen sizes; Touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate sizing; Accessible across devices and input methods

### III. Minimal Dependencies
Dependencies must be justified by clear necessity; Prefer vanilla JS/CSS over frameworks when possible; Bundle size impact must be considered for every addition; Regular dependency audits and removal of unused packages

### IV. Performance First
Fast loading times across all devices and connections; Optimized assets (images, fonts, scripts); Lazy loading for non-critical content; Core Web Vitals compliance required

### V. Accessibility & Standards
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum; Semantic HTML structure; Progressive enhancement principles; Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Build & Deployment Standards
<!-- Static site generation and deployment requirements -->

All builds must produce static assets only; Automated builds and deployments required; Version control for all configuration files; Environment-specific builds supported (dev/staging/prod); CDN-optimized output with proper caching headers

## Development Workflow
<!-- Code quality and development process requirements -->

Component-based development approach; Design system consistency required; Code review mandatory for all changes; Performance testing integration; Regular dependency audits and cleanup

## Governance
<!-- Constitution enforcement and amendment process -->

Constitution supersedes all other development practices; Performance and accessibility cannot be compromised for features; Dependency additions require clear justification and team approval; Use semantic versioning for all releases
