# Feature Specification: MCP Server Analytics Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-building`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we are building a one-page web app that is going to list the MCP server analytics. We will be using the existing MCP registry API to aggregate the data regularly and then present it to the user on one richly-formatted page with graphs. Page should be dark themed, it should follow a modern color scheme (purple, blue, pink). There are always ways to filter the servers by local or remote and that will reflect in the charts. The charts are timecharts - date on the X axis, counts on the Y axis, with hourly granularity. Granularity can also be switched - we can have hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. Because the counts are latest snapshots we can always rely on the latest value. The site also should have an about page."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Completed: MCP server analytics dashboard with charts and filters
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: analytics visualization, data aggregation, time-based filtering, dark theme UI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: view analytics ‚Üí filter data ‚Üí adjust granularity ‚Üí view insights
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on user capabilities and system behaviors
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí MCP servers, analytics data, time periods, filter states
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focused on user value, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interested in MCP ecosystem growth, I want to view analytics about MCP server adoption over time so I can understand trends, compare local vs remote server usage, and gain insights into the ecosystem's development.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit the analytics dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see time-based charts showing MCP server counts with a dark theme and modern color scheme
2. **Given** I'm viewing the analytics, **When** I toggle between "local" and "remote" server filters, **Then** the charts update to reflect only the selected server type
3. **Given** I'm viewing hourly data, **When** I change the granularity to daily/weekly/monthly, **Then** the charts re-aggregate and display data at the new time scale
4. **Given** I want to learn more about the dashboard, **When** I navigate to the about page, **Then** I see information about the analytics and data sources
5. **Given** I'm using a mobile device, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** the interface adapts responsively to my screen size

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there's no data for a selected time period?
- How does the system handle when API data is temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when a user tries to view data beyond the available historical range?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display time-based charts with MCP server counts on the Y-axis and dates on the X-axis
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide filter options to view local servers only, remote servers only, or all servers
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to switch between hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly data granularity
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply a dark theme with purple, blue, and pink color scheme throughout the interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST aggregate data from the MCP registry API and display the latest snapshot values
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-007**: System MUST include an about page explaining the analytics and data sources
- **FR-008**: System MUST update charts in real-time when filters or granularity settings change
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle empty data states gracefully with appropriate messaging
- **FR-010**: System MUST present all functionality on a single main page (one-page app design)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MCP Server**: Represents individual Model Context Protocol servers, categorized as local or remote, with timestamp data for analytics
- **Analytics Data Point**: Time-stamped count of servers at specific granularity (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Filter State**: Current user selection for server type (local/remote/all) and time granularity
- **Time Period**: Date range and granularity settings that determine what data is displayed in charts
