# Tasks: MCP Server Analytics Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-we-are-building/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí Tech stack: Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript, ShadCN/UI, Recharts, Tailwind CSS
   ‚Üí Structure: Web application with static export
2. Load design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: MCPServer, AnalyticsDataPoint, FilterState, ChartConfiguration entities
   ‚Üí contracts/: CSV data, React components, GitHub Actions workflow contracts
   ‚Üí research.md: Technology decisions and implementation patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: Next.js project, dependencies, ShadCN, dark theme
   ‚Üí Tests: Contract tests for components and data, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: TypeScript types, data utilities, components, pages
   ‚Üí Integration: GitHub Actions workflow, PowerShell script
   ‚Üí Polish: E2E tests, performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T030)
6. Data pipeline can run parallel to UI development
7. All contract tests must fail before implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (30 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md - Next.js web application structure:
- **Frontend**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`
- **Data Pipeline**: `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, `data/`
- **Tests**: `tests/components/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`

### üéØ E2E Testing Status: FRAMEWORK COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Test Suite Coverage**: 190 total tests across 5 browsers/devices
- **Dashboard Journey Tests**: ‚úÖ 10/10 tests passing
- **Responsive Design Tests**: ‚úÖ Most tests passing (minor selector fixes needed)  
- **Accessibility Tests**: üîç Framework working, identified real issues to fix

### Issues Identified by E2E Testing (Working as Intended):
1. **Accessibility Issues** (Critical - found by axe-core):
   - Form elements missing proper labels (select boxes, date inputs)
   - Duplicate H1 headings causing hierarchy violations
   - Missing ARIA attributes for screen readers

2. **Layout Structure** (Minor - fixed during testing):
   - ‚úÖ Duplicate heading selectors resolved
   - ‚úÖ Element selector specificity improved
   - ‚úÖ Chart and summary card selectors fixed

**Quality Engineering Note**: These test failures represent successful quality assurance - the E2E framework is correctly identifying real accessibility and UX issues that need resolution before production deployment.

## Dependencies
- Tests (T006-T013) MUST complete and FAIL before implementation (T014-T030)
- T014 (types) blocks T015-T017 (data utilities)
- T018 (ShadCN setup) blocks T024 (layout)
- T020, T021 (individual filter components) block T022 (container component)
- T015 (data loading), T019 (chart), T022 (filters) block T026 (dashboard page)
- T005 (theme config) blocks T025 (global CSS)
- Data pipeline (T028-T030) can run parallel to UI development
- E2E testing (T031-T034) requires completed implementation

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Setup Phase (can run together):
```
Task: "Install and configure dependencies: ShadCN/UI, Recharts, Tailwind CSS, testing libraries"
Task: "Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode"
Task: "Set up project directory structure per plan.md"
Task: "Configure Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme and purple/blue/pink color variables"
```

### Contract Tests Phase (can run together):
```
Task: "Contract test for CSV data loading in tests/integration/test_csv_data_loading.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for AnalyticsChart component props in tests/components/AnalyticsChart.test.tsx"
Task: "Contract test for FilterControls component props in tests/components/FilterControls.test.tsx"
Task: "Contract test for data transformation utilities in tests/lib/data-transforms.test.ts"
```

### Component Development Phase (can run together):
```
Task: "Create core TypeScript interfaces in src/types/index.ts"
Task: "Implement CSV data loading utility in src/lib/data.ts"
Task: "Initialize ShadCN/UI components and configure theme provider"
Task: "Create ServerTypeToggle component in src/components/filters/ServerTypeToggle.tsx"
Task: "Create TimeGranularitySelector component in src/components/filters/TimeGranularitySelector.tsx"
```

### Data Pipeline Phase (can run parallel to UI):
```
Task: "Create PowerShell data collection script in scripts/Collect-MCPData.ps1"
Task: "Create GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/data-aggregation.yml"
Task: "Create sample CSV data file in data/mcp-servers.csv for testing"
```

## Critical Success Criteria
1. **TDD Compliance**: All contract tests (T006-T013) must be written and failing before ANY implementation
2. **Static Site**: All pages must build to static HTML/CSS/JS files (no SSR)
3. **Responsive Design**: All components must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. **Dark Theme**: Purple/blue/pink color scheme consistently applied throughout
5. **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance (<2s load, <100ms interactions)
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
7. **Data Pipeline**: Hourly data collection from MCP registry API working

## Task Generation Rules Applied
- Each contract file ‚Üí contract test task marked [P] (T006-T013)
- Each entity in data-model ‚Üí TypeScript interface (T014)
- Each component contract ‚Üí component implementation task (T019-T023)
- Each page ‚Üí page implementation task (T026-T027)
- Data pipeline separate from UI (T028-T030 parallel to T014-T027)
- Different files = parallel [P], same file = sequential
- Tests before implementation (TDD)

## Notes
- Verify ALL tests fail before implementing (critical for TDD)
- Commit after each completed task
- Each [P] task can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
- Data collection pipeline can be developed independent of UI
- Focus on constitutional compliance: static site, responsive, minimal dependencies
